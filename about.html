            From an early age, He showed curiosity about how things work, in which he later discovered that it is a
            whole
            science field called mechanics. The seed of his love for mechanics was sown by another major part of his
            life,
            which is reading, by reading books he fed his initial interest in mechanics and evolved his imagination and
            creativity. Those passions <br> of his never subsided and grew year after year.
